.HP
\fB\-i\fR,\-\-indel=<score>(\fB\-350\fR)
.IP

deletion, i.e. score for a consecutive run of deletions or insertions.
Indel opening score and indel score define the affine scoring of gaps.

that tau=0 suppresses any effect on the latter.

sequence similarity at ends of base matches (if a scoring matrix like
ribosum is used, this adds the contributions for base pair match from the
matrix). [default tau=0!]

.SS "Input files:"
.IP
The tool is called with two input files <Input 1> and <Input 2>, which
specify the two input sequences or input alignments. Different input
formats (Fasta, Clustal, Stockholm, LocARNA PP, ViennaRNA postscript
dotplots) are accepted and automatically recognized (by file content); the
two input files can be in different formats. Extended variants of the
Clustal and Stockholm formats enable specifying anchor and structure
constraints.
.SH ">DESCRIPTION"

sparse is an even faster, stronger sparsified pairwise alignment
algorithm than locarna. Like locarna, it performs fast simultaneous
folding and alignment based on two RNA sequences (or alignments). In
addition to the filtering of considered base pairs by their
probabilities, it filters by conditional probabilities of bases and
base pairs in their enclosing loops.

.SS Input, Constraints, and Output

.PP
The usage, input, constraints-specifications and output are analogous
to locarna; please refer to the help or man page of locarna for
explanations and examples.
