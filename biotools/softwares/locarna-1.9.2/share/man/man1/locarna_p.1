USAGE: ../../src/locarna_p [options] <Input 1> <Input 2>
.SH OPTIONS
.HP
\fB\-h\fR,\-\-help
.IP
Print this help.
.HP
\fB\-V\fR,\-\-version
.IP
Print only version string.
.HP
\fB\-v\fR,\-\-verbose
.IP
Be verbose. Prints input parameters, sequences and size information.
.HP
\fB\-q\fR,\-\-quiet
.IP
Be quiet.
.SS "Scoring parameters:"
.HP
\fB\-i\fR,\-\-indel=<score>(\fB\-350\fR)
.IP
Indel score. Score contribution of each single base insertion or
deletion. Indel opening score and indel score define the affine scoring
of gaps.
.HP
\fB\-\-indel\-opening=\fR<score>(\fB\-500\fR)
.IP
Indel opening score. Score contribution of opening an insertion or
deletion, i.e. score for a consecutive run of deletions or insertions.
Indel opening score and indel score define the affine scoring of gaps.
.HP
\fB\-\-ribosum\-file=\fR<f>(RIBOSUM85_60)
.IP
File specifying the Ribosum base and base\-pair similarities. [default:
use RIBOSUM85_60 without requiring a Ribosum file.]
.HP
\fB\-\-use\-ribosum=\fR<bool>(true)
.IP
Use ribosum scores for scoring base matches and base pair matches; note
that tau=0 suppresses any effect on the latter.
.HP
\fB\-m\fR,\-\-match=<score>(50)
.IP
Set score contribution of a base match (unless ribosum scoring).
.HP
\fB\-M\fR,\-\-mismatch=<score>(0)
.IP
Set score contribution of a base mismatch (unless ribosum scoring).
.HP
\fB\-s\fR,\-\-struct\-weight=<score>(200)
.IP
Maximal weight of 1/2 arc match. Balances structure vs. sequence score
contributions.
.HP
\fB\-e\fR,\-\-exp\-prob=<prob>
.IP
Expected base pair probability. Used as background probability for base
pair scoring [default: calculated from sequence length].
.HP
\fB\-t\fR,\-\-tau=<factor>(0)
.IP
Tau factor. Factor for contribution of sequence similarity in an arc
match (in percent). tau=0 does not penalize any sequence information
including compensatory mutations at arc matches, while tau=100 scores
sequence similarity at ends of base matches (if a scoring matrix like
ribosum is used, this adds the contributions for base pair match from the
matrix). [default tau=0!]
.HP
\fB\-\-temperature\-alipf=\fR<int>(150)
.IP
Temperature for the /alignment/ partition functions (this temperature
different from the 'physical' temperature of RNA folding!). It controls
the probability distributions of computed base and arc match
probabilities.
.HP
\fB\-\-pf\-scale=\fR<scale>(1.0)
.IP
Factor for scaling the partition functions. Use in order to avoid
overflow.
.SS "Output:"
.HP
\fB\-\-write\-arcmatch\-probs=\fR<file>
.IP
Write arcmatch probabilities
.HP
\fB\-\-write\-basematch\-probs=\fR<file>
.IP

.HP
\fB\-a\fR,\-\-min\-am\-prob=<amprob>(0.0005)
.IP
Minimal arc match probability. Write probabilities for only the arc
matchs of at least this probability.
.HP
\fB\-b\fR,\-\-min\-bm\-prob=<bmprob>(0.0005)
.IP
Minimal base match probability. Write probabilities for only the base
matchs of at least this probability.
.HP
\fB\-\-include\-am\-in\-bm\fR
.IP

.HP
\fB\-\-stopwatch\fR
.IP
Print run time informations.
.SS "Heuristics for speed accuracy trade off:"
.HP
\fB\-p\fR,\-\-min\-prob=<prob>(0.0005)
.IP
Minimal probability. Only base pairs of at least this probability are
taken into account.
.HP
\fB\-\-max\-bps\-length\-ratio=\fR<factor>(0.0)
.IP
Maximal ratio of #base pairs divided by sequence length. This serves as a
second filter on the "significant" base pairs. [default: 0.0 = no
effect].
.HP
\fB\-D\fR,\-\-max\-diff\-am=<diff>(\fB\-1\fR)
.IP
Maximal difference for sizes of matched arcs. [\-1=off]
.HP
\fB\-d\fR,\-\-max\-diff=<diff>(\fB\-1\fR)
.IP
Maximal difference for positions of alignment traces (and aligned bases).
[\-1=off]
.HP
\fB\-\-max\-diff\-at\-am=\fR<diff>(\fB\-1\fR)
.IP
Maximal difference for positions of alignment traces at arc match ends.
[\-1=off]
.HP
\fB\-\-max\-diff\-aln=\fR<aln file>()
.IP
Maximal difference relative to given alignment (file in clustalw format)
.HP

.SS "Computed probabilities:"
.HP
\fB\-\-fragment\-match\-probs=\fR<"i j k l">()
.IP
Requests probabilities for the match of fragments [i..j] and [k..l].
Accepts a ';' separated list of ranges.
.SS "Constraints:"
.HP
\fB\-\-maxBPspan=\fR<span>(\fB\-1\fR)
.IP
Limit maximum base pair span [default=off].
.HP
\fB\-\-relaxed\-anchors\fR
.IP
Use relaxed semantics of anchor constraints [default=strict semantics].
.SS "Input files:"
.IP
The tool is called with two input files <Input 1> and <Input 2>, which
specify the two input sequences or input alignments. Different input
formats (Fasta, Clustal, Stockholm, LocARNA PP, ViennaRNA postscript
dotplots) are accepted and automatically recognized (by file content); the
two input files can be in different formats. Extended variants of the
Clustal and Stockholm formats enable specifying anchor and structure
constraints.
.SH EXAMPLES

Please see the documentation of locarna for call and input constraint
examples.
.SH ">DESCRIPTION"

locarna_p computes sequence and structure match probabilities from
partition functions of locarna pairwise alignments, i.e. from fast
simultaneous folding and alignment based on two RNA sequences (or
alignments).

.SS Input and Constraints

.PP
Please see the documentation of locarna for inputs and the possible
constraints specifications. 

.SS Output

.PP

Probabilities of base and base pair matches can be written to
files. (The total partition function is reported to standard out.)
.SH DISCLAIMERS

locarna_p is a low level tool; most often this tool is used
indirectly, by calling mlocarna with --probabilistic.  Note that the
performance of locarna_p (as well as basically all tools in the
LocARNA package) is often significantly improved by the use of
suitable application-specific options, deviating from the default
settings.
