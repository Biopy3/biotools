.SH EXAMPLES

Essentially exparna_p is called in the same way as locarna and the
other pairwise alignemnt tools of the package. Please refer to their
documentation. Note that exparna is usually called with single
sequences rather than alignments.
.SH ">DESCRIPTION"

exparna_p performs pairwise matching and folding, i.e. it determines
exactly matching local favourable sub-structures that can be
simulataneously formed in the input RNAs.

.SS Input

.PP
Input consists of two sequences or alignments, which are specified in
fasta, clustal, stockholm, or LocARNA pp format.

Optionally, one can specify structure and anchor constraints in these
input files.

.SS Output

.PP
The program enumerates exactly matching local substructures (exact
pattern matches = EPMs) and optionally chains them. It returns lists
of chained and unchained matches, visualizations of the results and
anchor constraints for alignment.
